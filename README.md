## Welcome to IDS 2020

Welcome to the course website for *Introduction to Data Science for Policymaking Using R*, or **IDS 2020**. In this course, we survey some of the commonly used research designs for public policy research, as well as introduce students to the programming language of R. 

The first cohort of the course went through a number of challenges, including the all-online classes, in intensive 6 weeks format, with no TA support, to mention a few. However, together, they have gone through the pain and suffering, preservered, and all came out in one piece at the end of the tunnel. 

I am extremely delighted to the final course projects by our students below.
